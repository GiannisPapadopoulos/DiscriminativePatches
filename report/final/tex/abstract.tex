This project is expected to apply the recently introduced algorithm of discovering mid-level discriminative patches \cite{Singh2012DiscPat}\cite{doersch2012what} on the problem of Human-Computer Interaction. In particular, the question, what visual or expressive features describe a particular emotion or cognitive state, should be answered. Such emotions or states are retrieved from images showing particular facial expressions of human beings. To achieve this goal, this project will apply machine learning techniques from Artificial Intelligence in the field of Image Processing for classification.
