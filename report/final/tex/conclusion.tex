\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The paper described the work and results of the research project on Mid-level Discriminative Patches. An application has been developed making use of the main parts of the algorithm proposed by Singh et Al. \cite{Singh2012DiscPat} namely the feature extraction using HOG and the trained classifier using SVM.

From the results of the experiments, it is clear that among all the manually extracted patches, mouth patch is the most representative and distinguishable. The face, as a whole patch, is high-level patch and has too much information. Results of the experiments performed on whole face patches are poorer than mid-level (manually extracted) patches.
