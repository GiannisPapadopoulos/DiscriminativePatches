\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The paper described the work and results of the research project on Mid-level Discriminative Patches. An application has been developed making use of the main parts of the algorithm proposed by Singh et Al. \cite{Singh2012DiscPat} namely the feature extraction using HOG and the trained classifier using SVM.
