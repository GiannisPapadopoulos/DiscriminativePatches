\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The paper described the work and results of the research project on Mid-level Discriminative Patches. An application has been developed making use of the main parts of the algorithm proposed by Singh et Al. namely the feature extraction using HOG and the trained classifier using SVM.

The results were not as good as expected which might be due to possible overfitting on the tested dataset. To fight this issue and enhance the work more data should be found and used in an additional test run.
