This chapter presents the group's work that has been conducted. First the project setup and preliminary work is described then the implementation of the algorithm is explained.


\subsection{Software Application}

The application is capable of loading image datasets from two folders defined on the command-line input. One should be the dataset containing the positive features and the other containing any other features. The application splits the datasets into defined parts for training and validation. To obtain more data needed for successful training, additional images from the horizontally flipped versions of the input images are computed and added to the datasets. Then the features for all images are computed using the OpenCV HOGDescriptor. To enhance the feature detection the images are adjusted beforehand by histogram equalization using the corresponding OpenCV method to increase the contrast of the image and produce sharper edges for the edge gradient computation of the HOG feature extractor. The computed features for the positive and negative training datasets are then combined in a training matrix which is fed into the OpenCV SVM instance together with according labels indicating positive and negative samples in the training matrix. Finally the SVM predicts the patches from the validation datasets and the prediction results are displayed.
